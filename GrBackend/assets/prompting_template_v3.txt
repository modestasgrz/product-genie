Your task is a Named Entity Recognition (NER) task. Find each of the given categories
and predict, select a value from the given available values associated with each
category. Give your output as a JSON payload.

Available categories and their selectable values:
{
    "Movement" : [
        "A product spins 360 by itself, camera static",
        "Camera orbits 360 around the product",
        "Camera dutch-angle-zoom in on the product, product static",
        "Camera zoom in on the product, product static",
        "Camera zoom out from the product, product static",
        "Camera top view rotation, product static",
        "Dolly pan left, product static",
        "Dolly pan right, product static",
        "Close up spin on logo, product static",
        "Pan from the top to the packshot, product static",
        "Camera static, product rotates diagonally",
        "Camera static, far away, product static",
        "Camera static, close up, product static"
    ],
    Movement_Interpolation : [
        "None",
        "BEZIER",
        "LINEAR",
        "CONSTANT"
    ]
    "VFX" : [
        "None",
        "Sparkles overlay effect",
        "Snowing overlay effect",
        "Vegetables fly behind product",
        "Vegetables explode behind product",
        "Berries fly behind product",
        "Berries explode behind product",
        "Lemon fly behind product",
        "Lemon explode behind product",
        "Fire burst overlay",
        "Screen frost overlay",
        "Lighting",
        "Flowers overlay effect"
    ],
    VFX_Interpolation : [
        "None",
        "BEZIER",
        "LINEAR",
        "CONSTANT"
    ]
}

Additionally, select an appropriate Movement speed and VFX speed values, each in range between 0.0 and 2.0.
0.0 being still shot, 2.0 - the fastest value. If you're unsure, give default values:
For Movement_Speed default value is 1.2
For VFX_Speed default value is 1.0
Then paste each values to output payload as:
    "Movement_Speed" : <your selected floating point value between 0.0 and 2.0 or default 1.2>
    "VFX_Speed" : <your selected floating point value between 0.0 and 2.0 or default 1.0>

Below are an example:
Input: Camera zooming into the bottle while lemons fly behind it that are interpolated linearly
Output: {
    "Movement": "Camera zoom in on the product, product static",
    "Movement_Speed" : 1.2,
    "Movement_Interpolation" : "None",
    "VFX": "Lemon fly behind product",
    "VFX_Speed" : 1.0,
    "VFX_Interpolation" : "LINEAR"
}

If you find "Movement" undefined, choose any of the provided "Movement" value you find appropriate, from the values list.
If you find "VFX", "Movement_Interpolation", or "VFX_Interpolation" undefined, choose "None" value for this undefined entity.
Now, complete the task.

Input: %s
