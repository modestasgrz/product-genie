Your task is a Named Entity Recognition (NER) task. Find each of the given categories
and predict, select a value from the given available values associated with each
category. Give your output as a JSON payload.

Available categories and their selectable values:
{
    "Movement" : [
        "PRODUCT_360",
        "CAMERA_360",
        "CAMERA_DUTCH_ZOOM_IN",
        "ZOOM_IN",
        "ZOOM_OUT",
        "CAMERA_TOP_SPIN",
        "CAMERA_PAN_LEFT",
        "CAMERA_PAN_RIGHT",
        "CAMERA_CLOSE_SPIN",
        "CAMERA_TOP_PACKSHOT",
        "PRODUCT_DIAGONAL_ROTATE",
        "CAMERA_STILL_FAR",
        "CAMERA_STILL_CLOSE",
    ],
    Movement_Interpolation : [
        "None",
        "BEZIER",
        "LINEAR",
        "CONSTANT"
    ]
    "VFX" : [
        "None",
        "VFX_SPARKLE",
        "VFX_SNOW",
        "VFX_VEGETABLE_FLOAT",
        "VFX_VEGETABLE_EXPLODE",
        "VFX_BERRY_FLOAT",
        "VFX_BERRY_EXPLODE",
        "VFX_LEMON_FLOAT",
        "VFX_LEMON_EXPLODE",
        "VFX_FIRE",
        "VFX_FREEZE",
        "VFX_LIGHTNING",
        "VFX_FLOWERS",
    ],
    VFX_Interpolation : [
        "None",
        "BEZIER",
        "LINEAR",
        "CONSTANT"
    ]
}

Additionally, select an appropriate Movement speed and VFX speed values, each in range between 0.0 and 2.0.
0.0 being still shot, 2.0 - the fastest value. If you're unsure, give default values:
For Movement_Speed default value is 1.2
For VFX_Speed default value is 1.0
Then paste each values to output payload as:
    "Movement_Speed" : <your selected floating point value between 0.0 and 2.0 or default 1.2>
    "VFX_Speed" : <your selected floating point value between 0.0 and 2.0 or default 1.0>

Below are an example:
Input: Camera zooming into the bottle while lemons fly behind it that are interpolated linearly
Output: {
    "Movement": "ZOOM_IN",
    "Movement_Speed" : 1.2,
    "Movement_Interpolation" : "None",
    "VFX": "VFX_LEMON_FLOAT",
    "VFX_Speed" : 1.0,
    "VFX_Interpolation" : "LINEAR"
}

If you find "Movement" undefined, choose any of the provided "Movement" value you find appropriate, from the values list.
If you find "VFX", "Movement_Interpolation", or "VFX_Interpolation" undefined, choose "None" value for this undefined entity.
Now, complete the task.
